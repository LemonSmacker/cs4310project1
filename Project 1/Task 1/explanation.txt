This program acts like a divide and conquer algorithm, where each half is sorted and then combined into one array.

A sample list of integers are used on line 8, although they can be changed to any values.
thread1 and thread2 take the first and second halves of the globalArray.
Both halves are then sorted using the sort() command.
The two halves are compared and inserted into the sortedArray accordingly, depending on which is less.
